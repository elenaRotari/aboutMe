          <p>
            I'm Elena, I am 36 years old and I am comming from Moldova, but
            above all I am:
            <span class="textStyle"
              ><strong
                ><em> Woman, Mother, Child and of course a Human.</em></strong
              ></span
            >
          <p>I was born in May, which means I love flowers and spring, I love
            happy companies and open minded people. I appreciate personalities
            with character, with principles, with dignity, as well as those who
            have a well-developed sense of humor. <br />
            As I mentioned above, I am a Mother and I have been raising my
            children for some time absolutely alone, which has changed
            fundamental my character and personality. And that's exactly what
            motivated me almost 6 years ago to emigrate from my home country -
            to Germany, and this decision was one of the best decisions since
            then. </p>

            <p><span class="country"><strong>Moldova - </strong></span>Despite the
            fact that Moldova is a small country, located between Romania and
            Ukraine, it hosts a society with many beautiful qualities and
            traditions preserved over time. To find out more about my home
            country you can access the link below <br />

            </p>
            <p>
            <span class="country"><strong>Germany - </strong></span> in 2017
            Germany has adopted us as orphans and given us all this stability
            and an opportunity for a different future. Here I met beautiful
            people both face and soul. Here I discovered that
            <strong>"I can't"</strong>- it doesn't exist and if the
            <strong>Motivation and Desire</strong> is high - you can achieve
            success.
